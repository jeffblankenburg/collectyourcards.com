## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive crowdsourcing strategy to enable community-driven data collection for sports card information while maintaining high data quality and providing meaningful incentives for contributors. The system combines proven crowdsourcing methodologies from successful platforms like Wikipedia, OpenStreetMap, and iNaturalist with gamification elements inspired by Stack Overflow and Reddit.

**Core Objectives:**
- Enable scalable data collection for the massive sports card ecosystem
- Maintain data quality through multi-tiered verification systems  
- Create engaging user experience that feels fun, not cumbersome
- Provide economic incentives through credit system to offset subscription costs
- Build a self-sustaining community of contributors

## 1. System Overview & Philosophy

### 1.1 The Crowdsourcing Challenge

Sports card data is massive and complex:
- **Estimated scope**: 50M+ individual cards across decades
- **Data complexity**: Multiple series, parallels, variations, print runs
- **Specialized knowledge**: Requires domain expertise for accurate identification
- **Time sensitivity**: New releases require immediate updates

### 1.2 Core Philosophy: "Easy, Fun, Rewarding"

Based on research of successful crowdsourcing platforms, our system will prioritize:

1. **Simplicity**: Break complex data entry into micro-tasks
2. **Gamification**: Achievement-based progression with Xbox-style scoring
3. **Community**: Peer verification and collaborative improvement
4. **Recognition**: Status, badges, and tangible rewards
5. **Quality**: Multi-layer verification without bureaucratic friction

## 2. Credit Economy System

### 2.1 Economic Model

**Subscription Baseline:**
- Free tier: Up to 100 cards in collection
- Paid tier: $5-10/month for unlimited collection size

**Credit System:**
- **1 Credit = $0.10 USD** (allows precise micro-transactions)
- **Monthly subscription = 50-100 Credits**
- Credits can be earned through crowdsourcing activities
- Credits roll over month-to-month (no expiration)
- Users can earn enough to fully offset subscription costs

## 3. Data Quality & Verification System

### 3.1 Multi-Tiered Quality Framework

Inspired by iNaturalist's classification system:

#### Tier 1: "Submitted" (Raw Data)
- **Status**: Newly submitted, unverified
- **Visibility**: Hidden from public search
- **Requirements**: Basic information only
- **Contributor**: Anyone can submit

#### Tier 2: "Under Review" (Peer Review)
- **Status**: Being verified by community
- **Visibility**: Visible to reviewers only
- **Requirements**: 2 community verifications needed
- **Quality Gates**: Automated checks passed

#### Tier 3: "Community Verified" (High Confidence)
- **Status**: Verified by community
- **Visibility**: Full public visibility
- **Requirements**: 3+ verifications, no conflicts
- **Quality**: Production-ready data

#### Tier 4: "Expert Verified" (Highest Quality)
- **Status**: Verified by trusted experts
- **Visibility**: Featured in search results
- **Requirements**: Expert-level contributor verification
- **Gold Standard**: Used for training AI models

### 3.2 Automated Quality Checks

**Immediate Validation:**
- Required fields completion
- Data format validation (numbers, dates)
- Image quality assessment (resolution, blur detection)
- Duplicate detection algorithms
- Cross-reference with existing data

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Suspicious data patterns (bot detection)
- Consistency checks across related records
- Price/value reasonableness checks
- Print run validation against known ranges

### 3.3 Community Verification Process

**Verification Workflow:**
1. **Auto-Assignment**: System assigns reviews based on expertise
2. **Blind Review**: Reviewers see submission without contributor name
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Disputes escalated to expert reviewers
4. **Consensus Building**: Require majority agreement for approval

**Reviewer Selection:**
- **Trust Score Weighting**: Higher trust users get priority
- **Domain Expertise**: Match reviewers to their specialty areas
- **Workload Balancing**: Distribute reviews evenly
- **Conflict Avoidance**: Avoid reviewer conflicts of interest
