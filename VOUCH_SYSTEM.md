# CollectYourCards Vouch & Trustworthiness System

## Overview

The Vouch System is a comprehensive trustworthiness framework designed specifically for the sports card collecting community. Unlike traditional social networking "friend" systems, vouching represents a formal endorsement of another collector's reliability, integrity, and trustworthiness in trading, selling, and community interactions.

## Philosophy: Vouching vs. Friendship

### Vouching (Business Trust)
- **Purpose**: Professional endorsement of trustworthiness in transactions
- **Weight**: Carries significant meaning and responsibility
- **Reciprocity**: Not necessarily mutual (A can vouch for B without B vouching for A)
- **Requirements**: Based on actual positive experiences (trades, purchases, interactions)
- **Permanence**: Carefully considered and can be revoked with cause
- **Visibility**: Public trust scores and vouch counts displayed on profiles
- **Impact**: Affects ability to participate in high-value transactions and exclusive events

### Friendship (Social Connection)
- **Purpose**: Social networking and community building
- **Weight**: Casual social connection
- **Reciprocity**: Usually mutual acceptance required
- **Requirements**: Interest-based or personal preference
- **Permanence**: Can be added/removed casually
- **Visibility**: Friends lists may be private
- **Impact**: Affects social features like activity feeds and messaging

## Trust Score Calculation System

### Core Trust Score Formula
```
Trust Score = (Weighted Vouch Points + Transaction History + Community Standing + Time Factor) × Decay Factor

Where:
- Weighted Vouch Points: Sum of all vouches weighted by voucher's trust score
- Transaction History: Successful trade/sale completion rate and volume
- Community Standing: Achievement points, comment quality, report history
- Time Factor: Account age and consistent activity bonus
- Decay Factor: Gradual reduction for inactive accounts
```

### Detailed Scoring Components

#### 1. Weighted Vouch Points (40% of score)
```
Vouch Value = Base Points × Voucher's Trust Score × Relationship Multiplier × Verification Level

Base Points by Vouch Type:
- Transaction Vouch: 100 points (completed trade/sale)
- Interaction Vouch: 50 points (positive community interaction)
- Knowledge Vouch: 75 points (expertise recognition)
- Character Vouch: 200 points (general trustworthiness)

Voucher's Trust Score Multiplier:
- Platinum Collector (950-1000): 1.0x
- Gold Collector (800-949): 0.9x
- Silver Collector (650-799): 0.8x
- Bronze Collector (500-649): 0.7x
- New Collector (0-499): 0.5x

Relationship Multiplier:
- No prior relationship: 1.0x

- Identity Verification: 1.2x
- Address Verification: 1.15x
- All Verifications: 1.3x
```

#### 2. Transaction History (30% of score)
```
Transaction Score = (Success Rate × Volume Bonus × Value Tier × Recency Bonus)

Success Rate:
- 100% completion: 100 points
- 95-99% completion: 85 points

Value Tier Bonus:
- $0-50 transactions: 1.0x
- $51-200 transactions: 1.1x
- $201-500 transactions: 1.2x
- $501-1000 transactions: 1.3x
- $1000+ transactions: 1.5x

Recency Bonus:
- Active last 30 days: 1.1x
- Active last 90 days: 1.05x
- Active last 180 days: 1.0x
- Inactive 180+ days: 0.9x
```

#### 3. Community Standing (20% of score)
```
Community Score = Achievement Points + Comment Quality + Report History + Moderation Status

Achievement Points:

Comment Quality:
- Helpful comments marked: +2 points each (max 50 points)
- Comments with positive reactions: +1 point each (max 25 points)

- 4+ resolved reports: -10 points
- Active warnings: -25 points

Moderation Status:
- No moderation actions: +25 points
- Past temporary restrictions: -10 points
- Current restrictions: -50 points
```

#### 4. Time Factor (10% of score)
```
Time Bonus = Account Age Bonus + Activity Consistency Bonus

Account Age Bonus:
- 0-3 months: 0 points
- 3-6 months: 10 points
- 6-12 months: 20 points
- 1-2 years: 35 points
- 2+ years: 50 points

Activity Consistency Bonus:

**Verification**: Self-reported with community validation period (7 days for challenges)
**Points**: 75 base points
**Evidence**: Specific expertise area, examples of knowledge shared

**Verification**: Self-reported with optional screenshots/context
**Points**: 50 base points

## Vouch System Safeguards

### Anti-Gaming Measures

#### 1. Reciprocal Vouch Limitations
- Maximum 1 vouch exchange per pair of users per 6-month period
- Reciprocal vouches within 24 hours flagged for review
- Weight reduction (0.8x) for obvious reciprocal vouching

#### 2. Vouch Velocity Limits
- Maximum 5 vouches given per user per month
- Maximum 3 vouches received per user per month for new accounts (<6 months)
- Gradual unlock of vouch capacity based on trust score

#### 3. Network Analysis
- Detection of vouch circles/rings (A→B→C→A patterns)
- Penalty for participating in artificial vouch networks
- Machine learning detection of unusual vouching patterns

#### 4. Verification Requirements
- Vouchers must have verified email and phone
- High-value vouches require identity verification
- Cross-reference with external fraud databases

### Vouch Challenges & Disputes

#### Challenge Process
1. **Challenge Period**: All new vouches have a 7-day challenge period
2. **Evidence Required**: Challengers must provide specific evidence
3. **Community Review**: Public voting by trusted collectors (Silver+ tier)
4. **Admin Override**: Final decision by platform moderators

#### Valid Challenge Reasons
- No evidence of actual interaction/transaction
- Suspected sock puppet account
- Voucher has history of fraudulent activity
- Vouch appears to be part of gaming scheme

#### Consequences for Fraudulent Vouches
- **First Offense**: Warning and vouch removal
- **Second Offense**: 30-day vouch suspension
- **Third Offense**: Permanent vouch privileges revocation
- **Severe Cases**: Account suspension or ban
