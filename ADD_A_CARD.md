This page needs to allow a user to enter data for a card that they have in their hands.  They're physically holding, for example, a card with some limited information on it:

Player: Alexander Schlager
Team: Austria National Team
Card Number: 1
Series Name: Pitch Masters
Set Name: 2021 Panini - Mosaic UEFA Euro Soccer
The card also has an RC badge on the front, and then in caps, the word PRIZM on the back.

That's literally the most they could know about this card.  It doesn't tell them what the set name is.  It doesn't tell them that it's a parallel of the base card.  And now they want to add it to their collection.  Most cards have even less information.  Card number, player name, team name.  That's it.  Everything else is potentially an assumption.

We need to be ready for this kind of user.  Frequently.  Our current attempt, at /add-card, is terrible.  It allows a user to enter data, but never shows them cards that might be a match.  It shows everything they type as "pending" without really explaining what any of that means.  It ends with a button that reads "Add to My Collection", but we don't have nearly enough information to actually accomplish this task.

Users need to be able to immediately either find a card (based on what they know), or add a card (because it doesn't already exist).
