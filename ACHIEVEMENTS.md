# CollectYourCards Achievement System

## Overview
The CollectYourCards Achievement System is a comprehensive gamification framework designed to reward and recognize collectors for their activities, milestones, and contributions to the community.

## Achievement Processing Architecture

### Real-Time Processing
- Card addition/removal triggers immediate achievement checks
- Collection value updates trigger value-based achievements
- User actions (comments, shares, trades) trigger social achievements

### Batch Processing
- Daily: Check streak achievements, statistical achievements
- Weekly: Recalculate percentile ranks, check weekly milestones
- Monthly: Process long-term achievements, generate reports

### Achievement Engine Components

1. **Event Listener Service**
   - Monitors all user actions
   - Queues achievement checks based on action type
   - Handles real-time achievement unlocks

2. **Achievement Calculator Service**
   - Processes achievement check queue
   - Runs requirement queries
   - Updates progress and completion status
   - Handles point awards and removals

3. **Notification Service**
   - Sends achievement unlock notifications
   - Updates user interface in real-time
   - Handles achievement sharing to social

4. **Leaderboard Service**
   - Maintains global achievement rankings
   - Calculates percentile ranks
   - Handles achievement-based competitions

## Scoring & Weighting System

### Point Distribution Philosophy
- **Accessibility**: 40% of achievements should be obtainable by casual collectors
- **Challenge**: 30% should require dedicated effort
- **Elite**: 20% should be for serious collectors
- **Legendary**: 10% should be extremely difficult

### Dynamic Point Adjustments
- Achievements can have bonus multipliers during events
- First 100 users to unlock an achievement get 10% bonus
- Seasonal achievements worth double during their season
- Streak achievements gain multipliers for longer streaks

### Achievement Rarity Scoring
```
Rarity Score = Base Points * (1 + (1 - Completion Rate))
```
- If only 1% of users have an achievement, it's worth nearly double points
- Dynamically adjusts monthly based on completion rates

### Total Collector Score Calculation
```
Total Score = Sum of All Achievement Points + Bonus Points + Event Points - Lost Achievement Points
```

### Leaderboard Categories
1. **Total Points** - Overall achievement score
2. **Monthly Points** - Points earned this month
3. **Category Leaders** - Top scorers in each category
4. **Rarest Achievements** - Users with the rarest achievements
5. **Completion Percentage** - Users closest to 100% completion
